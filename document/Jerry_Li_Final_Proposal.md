#### Dataset Selection and Relevance

For this project, I have selected the **FIFA 22** dataset, which contains extensive data on professional soccer players. The dataset includes 65 features, such as player attributes, ratings, and physical characteristics, with 16,710 samples. As a soccer enthusiast, I find this dataset particularly interesting because it provides a rich source of data that can be analyzed to uncover patterns and insights within the world of soccer. The diverse features in this dataset allow for a comprehensive exploration of how various attributes correlate with player performance, market value, and potential growth.

#### Source of Dataset

My dataset is download from [Kaggle&#39;s FIFA Player Stats Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/fifa-player-stats-database?resource=download).

#### Description of Variables

The FIFA 22 dataset contains a comprehensive set of 65 features. Due to space limitations, I will highlight a few key variables as examples:

* **Overall Rating** : A numerical score representing the player's overall performance level.
* **Potential** : The projected future rating of the player, indicating their potential for improvement.
* **Position** : The specific role or position that the player occupies on the field (e.g., Forward, Midfielder, Defender).
* **Height and Weight** : Physical measurements of the players that could impact their style of play and effectiveness.
* **Skill Moves and Weak Foot** : Technical attributes that measure the playerâ€™s dribbling ability and proficiency with their non-dominant foot.
* **International Reputation** : A measure of how well-known the player is on the international stage, potentially impacting their market value.

These variables help us understand how different qualities affect a player's success in soccer. The variety in the dataset allows us to look closely at what influences both individual and team performance.

#### Initial Hypotheses

Based on the variables provided in the dataset, the following hypotheses will guide the analysis:

- **Hypothesis 1** : Physical attributes such as height and weight are more influential for players in defensive positions than those in offensive positions, as physicality is often crucial for defensive roles.
- **Hypothesis 2** : Goalkeepers with higher reflex ratings tend to have better overall ratings, indicating that reflexes are a crucial attribute for goalkeeping success.
- **Hypothesis 3** : Players from more prestigious clubs (based on club reputation) tend to have higher market values, suggesting that club prestige influences player valuation.

#### Expected Outcomes

Through this analysis, I want to confirm or reject these hypotheses by exploring the relationships between key variables. The findings will highlight factors that contribute to a player's success and offer insights for optimizing player development and scouting strategies in professional soccer.
